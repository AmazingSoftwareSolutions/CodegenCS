# CodegenCS.DbSchema

**CodegenCS.DbSchema** represents the schema of a relational database. This just a library used by the other components (which will extract the schema of a relational database or generate code based on a db schema)

Previously it had scripts to reverse engineer a MSSQL database - those were moved to [**CodegenCS.DbSchema.Extractor**](https://github.com/CodegenCS/CodegenCS/tree/master/src/CodegenCS.DbSchema.Extractor) which currently supports MSSQL (Microsoft SQL Server) and PostgreSQL.
